Personal notes-

1. Very enjoyable project to develop as I had a keen interest in what it was providing, I was able to pug a lot of the knowledge I've learnt into practice, namely with react hooks.
2. Encountered more issues in implementing functionality than initially expected, this forced me to be more resilient and patient in finding solutions and/or workarounds to implement what I intended.
3. Learnt a lot on how to interpret and manipulate data to present it in the format that was required.
4. Began implementing testing and further understanding its importance.
